## Command Line Driven Program Tutorial \- PART 1


</div>

### Description

Hello fellow PSC users, I have written this tutorial (part one of a series) to teach the programmers that don't know about Command Line Driven programs how to develop them. Have you ever seen with Windows applications that you can go into Run and type "PING 255.255.255.255" (with out the "") and the program PING will ping the IP address 255.255.255.255. This series tutorial will start at the basics of Command Line Driven application programming and take you right up to the complex coding that can be developed in Visual Basic programming. I hope this tutorial will help you other VB programmers, and I hope to see a lot of nice programs uploaded onto PSC using this concept. The .zip file contains the tutorial (.doc format) and a sample program I have written in VB (fully commented). Best Regards, Coding MasterMind
